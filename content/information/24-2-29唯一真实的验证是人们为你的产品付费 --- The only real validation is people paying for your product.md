I still see people think "talking to customers" works when validating an idea, but people don't always know what they want.  I think real validation of an idea happens with executing it and then people getting their credit card out and paying you for it.  
我仍然看到人们认为“与客户交谈”在验证一个想法时有效，但人们并不总是知道他们想要什么。 我认为真实的验证一个想法发生在执行它，然后人们拿出他们的信用卡，并支付你的。

I think talking to people and asking them what to build USED to work because there wasn't as much stuff built as now.  But there's hundreds of websites/apps launched every day now, so even if you build what they want, the odds of them paying for it are less due to competition.  
我认为和人们交谈，问他们要建造什么是有用的，因为没有像现在这样建造那么多的东西。 但是现在每天都有数百个网站/应用程序推出，所以即使你构建了他们想要的东西，由于竞争，他们付费的几率也会降低。

That's why building more things, not less, and seeing what  exactly people will get their credit card out for and paying you money is, I think, how to get to validation these days.  
这就是为什么建立更多的东西，而不是更少，看看人们到底会得到他们的信用卡和支付你的钱，我认为，如何得到验证这些天。

There's a certain excessive self-confidence in working on a project for months/years without any paying customers and thinking it will just work out if only people realize how great your product is. But if people visit every day and not pay for it, that's daily rejection.  
在一个项目上工作几个月/几年，没有任何付费客户，并认为只要人们意识到你的产品有多棒，它就会成功，这是一种过度的自信。但如果人们每天都来，却不付钱，那就是每天都被拒绝。

That daily rejection should be a data point too. That's people EVERY day NOT paying for your product. That means something is severely wrong with your idea/execution. But instead entrepreneurs like to ignore this with "one day people will get it".  
每天的拒绝也应该是一个数据点。这是人们每天不支付你的产品。这意味着你的想法/执行有严重的问题。但相反，企业家们喜欢忽略这一点，“总有一天人们会得到它”。

And yes, sometimes it does work out, people iterate a product for a long time until ppl start paying for it. But this is way more seldom than ppl think. That's why funding is so risky, it removes the biggest incentive to build a product people actually want: making money.  
是的，有时它确实工作了，人们在很长一段时间内购买一个产品，直到人们开始为它付费。这就是为什么融资风险如此之大，它消除了人们真正想要的产品的最大动力：赚钱。

Being broke may be the best incentive to build something people want because you're struggling to pay rent and survive. There's no Plan B, there's no savings, there's no extra income. You'll build anything to make money, and that'll get you closer to market fit than most people.  
破产可能是建造人们想要的东西的最好激励，因为你正在努力支付租金和生存。没有计划B，没有储蓄，没有额外的收入。为了赚钱，你会做任何事情，这会让你比大多数人更接近市场。

This ties into entrepreneurship research: poorer countries generally have higher amounts of entrepreneurship than rich countries, out of necessity:  
这与创业研究有关：出于必要性，较贫穷国家的创业人数通常高于富裕国家：

> "people are far more entrepreneurial in the developing countries than in the developed countries. According to an OECD study, in most developing countries, 30-50 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce is self-employed (the ratio tends to be even higher in agriculture).  
> “发展中国家的人比发达国家的人更具有创业精神。根据经合组织的一项研究，在大多数发展中国家，30%至50%的非农业劳动力是自营职业者（在农业部门，这一比例往往更高）。
> 
> (..)  In some countries, the ratio does not even reach one in ten: 6.7 per cent in Norway, 7.5 per cent in the USA, and 8.6 per cent in France.
> 
>   
> （..）在一些国家，这一比例甚至不到十分之一：挪威为6.7%，美国为7.5%，法国为8.6%。
> 
> So, even excluding the farmers (which would make the ratio even higher), the chance of an average developing country person being an entrepreneur is more than twice that for a developed country person (30 per cent versus 12.8 per cent). The difference is 10 times, if we compare Bangladesh with the USA (7.5 per cent versus 75.4 per cent).

> 因此，即使不包括农民（这会使这一比例更高），发展中国家的普通人成为企业家的机会也是发达国家人的两倍多（30%对12.8%）。如果我们将孟加拉国与美国进行比较，差距是10倍（7.5%对75.4%）。
> 
> And in the most extreme case, the chance of someone from Benin being an entrepreneur is 13 times higher than the equivalent chance for a Norwegian (88.7 per cent versus 6.7 per cent)."

> 在最极端的情况下，贝宁人成为企业家的机会比挪威人高出13倍（88.7%对6.7%）。“

\- Ha-Joon Chang关于联合国大学

Starting from a place of comfort (savings, residual income) can ironically be a negative factor for entrepreneurial success because the difference between the result of you failing and succeeding is smaller: in both cases you'll still be able to pay your rent. Less incentive.  
具有讽刺意味的是，从一个舒适的地方（储蓄，剩余收入）开始可能是创业成功的一个负面因素，因为你失败和成功的结果之间的差异较小：在这两种情况下，你仍然能够支付房租。更少的激励。
