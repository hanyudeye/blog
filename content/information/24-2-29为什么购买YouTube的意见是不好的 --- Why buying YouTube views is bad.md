For my music channels on YouTube I receive music and video submissions daily. They’re mostly from unknown musicians and you never know when you’re going to find a great new artist. I always browse through the submissions and see if there’s any good stuff I could feature on my channel.  
对于我在YouTube上的音乐频道，我每天都会收到音乐和视频。他们大多来自不知名的音乐家，你永远不知道什么时候你会找到一个伟大的新艺术家。我总是浏览提交的内容，看看是否有什么好东西可以在我的频道上展示。

Now since these artists are usually unknown, their YouTube view amount is in the range of 0 to 5,000. Going above 1,000 is already a great start by the way.  
现在，由于这些艺术家通常是未知的，他们的YouTube观看量在0到5000之间。超过1,000已经是一个很好的开始。

Lately however, I’ve been getting videos by many unknown artists with 50,000 to 100,000 views.  
然而，最近，我收到了许多不知名艺术家的视频，观看次数在5万到10万之间。

So are these unknown artists breaking through right at the moment they email me? I must be a really lucky guy.  
那么，这些不知名的艺术家在给我发邮件的时候就有了突破吗？我一定是个幸运的家伙。

But no, too bad. They’re just buying their YouTube views.  
但不，太糟了。他们只是在买他们的YouTube浏览量。

There’s websites now selling YouTube views. These websites often control zombie-nets, which are virus-infected computers located all around the world. Some of these zombie-nets control up to 1,000,000 computers. After you pay those websites, they will queue your video up in all these computers and your video’s views will rise quickly to the amount you paid for.  
现在有网站在出售YouTube视频。这些网站通常控制着病毒网络，即遍布世界各地的受病毒感染的计算机。其中一些网络控制着多达100万台计算机。在你向这些网站付款后，他们会将你的视频在所有这些计算机上排队，你的视频的观看量会迅速上升到你支付的数量。

Besides it being completely unethical, it’s also quite obvious to spot when someone bought views.  
除了这是完全不道德的，这也是相当明显的发现，当有人购买的意见。

I did a count of the views/likes/comments on my videos and on average if I have 100,000 views, I usually have about 1,500 likes and 300 comments. This means 1 in 66 people likes the video after watching it, and 1 in 333 people comment on it. These are the metrics you should think of, and they don’t differ that much from non-music videos either.  
我对我的视频进行了观看/喜欢/评论的计数，平均来说，如果我有10万次观看，我通常有大约1,500个喜欢和300条评论。这意味着每66人中有1人在观看后喜欢该视频，每333人中有1人评论该视频。这些是你应该考虑的指标，它们与非音乐视频也没有太大区别。

The last video I received had 100,000 views, 50 likes and 20 comments. That means, 1 in 2000 people liked it, and 1 in 5000 people commented on it. Imagine this. 100,000 people watch a video. 20 people comment on it.  
我收到的最后一个视频有10万次观看，50个喜欢和20条评论。这意味着，2000人中有1人喜欢它，5000人中有1人评论它。想象一下。10万人观看视频。20人评论

It. Does. Not. Actually. Happen.  
了可以这没有事实上发生

I don’t like it that people are doing it. It’s unethical and unfair behavior. Content creators on YouTube like myself work our asses off to create the best videos for our audience. Views are simply everything, it’s simply the most important metric for success on YouTube. It’s just not possible to compete with videos that get attention because they receive 100,000 fake views in the first day. In the long-term it deters content creators from putting effort into producing videos and significantly hurts the YouTube creators ecosystem.  
我不喜欢人们这样做。这是不道德和不公平的行为。像我这样的YouTube内容创作者拼命工作，为我们的观众创造最好的视频。浏览量就是一切，它是YouTube成功的最重要指标。这是不可能与视频竞争，因为他们在第一天收到10万个虚假的意见。从长远来看，它阻碍了内容创作者投入精力制作视频，并严重损害了YouTube创作者的生态系统。

It’s not just views however, people are buying subscribers too.  
然而，这不仅仅是观点，人们也在购买订阅者。

In this chart anyone can spot what is happening. In two different moments in a matter of days, the channel adds 1,000 subscribers. The first increase is executed considerably more undercover (with a delay effect) than the second abrupt increase. Nonetheless, you’d expect YouTube to be able to spot both of these events right?  
在这个图表中，任何人都可以发现正在发生的事情。在几天内的两个不同时刻，该频道增加了1,000名订阅者。第一次增加比第二次突然增加更隐蔽地执行（具有延迟效应）。尽管如此，你希望YouTube能够发现这两个事件的权利？

From a technical standpoint I see the challenge for YouTube to solve this. If you have 100,000 different computers in a zombie-net automatically open up videos, how are you going to know if they are human or not? You can’t really have people enter a CAPTCHA before they watch a video right?  
从技术的角度来看，我认为YouTube面临着解决这个问题的挑战。如果你有10万台不同的电脑在一个自动打开视频的网络中，你怎么知道他们是不是人类？你不能让人们在看视频之前输入验证码，对吗？

YouTube is working on this though. They’ve been closing down zombie accounts by the thousands every day and this means that the fake views people buy, are actually removed as well. So buying these views is hardly sustainable, as they’ll just disappear and the video will then decrease in views again.  
YouTube正在为此努力。他们每天都在关闭数千个僵尸账户，这意味着人们购买的虚假视图实际上也被删除了。因此，购买这些观看次数几乎是不可持续的，因为它们会消失，视频的观看次数会再次减少。

To everyone buying their views, I’d just like to tell them what my parents always told me as a kid. In life there are no shortcuts, you have to put the hours in, work for it and then you get it in the end. Or you may not. Taking a shortcut might help you on the short-term but is not sustainable on the long-term. And often cheating the system will come back to bite you later.  
对于每个购买他们观点的人，我只想告诉他们我父母小时候总是告诉我的话。在生活中没有捷径，你必须投入时间，为之工作，然后你最终得到它。或者你不可以。走捷径可能会在短期内帮助你，但从长远来看是不可持续的。而且经常欺骗系统会回来咬你以后。

Make great things and people will flock to it like [bees](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmZvOhHF85I&ref=levels.io).  
做伟大的事情，人们会像蜜蜂一样蜂拥而至。
