[It's been almost a decade now](https://levels.io/remote-working-is-the-future/) that we've all been promoting the benefits of remote work and location independent living.  
近十年来，我们一直在宣传远程工作和独立生活的好处。

With the pandemic suddenly [shooting remote work into the mainstream](https://levels.io/the-greatest-migration/), it seems like people are finally starting to believe the merits of remote work. Most people don't _want_ to go back to the office and I strongly believe most people won't _go back_ to the office after the pandemic ends.  
随着大流行突然将远程工作纳入主流，人们似乎终于开始相信远程工作的优点。大多数人不想回到办公室，我坚信大流行结束后大多数人不会回到办公室。

We now have millions of people working remotely but most still have to work at specific hours, be on standby, take calls and attend virtual meetings.  
我们现在有数百万人远程工作，但大多数人仍然必须在特定的时间工作，待命，接听电话和参加虚拟会议。

What's the next thing after remote work is now mainstream? I think it's async work.  
在远程工作成为主流之后，下一件事是什么？我认为这是一个很好的工作。

## What is async? 什么是BTC？

Async is short for asynchronous and in this case it means being able to work without having to wait for someone else to answer.  
Async是asynchronous的缩写，在这种情况下，它意味着能够工作而不必等待其他人的回答。

With async you decide when you work, you're autonomous and the only thing that matters is if you get your work done. There's no manager looking over your shoulder, and you don't have to be on-call. You get a lot of responsibility and because of that you make sure you actually do great work. Because if you don't, you lose your job. But evaluating your performance stops being about showing up, it starts being about the quality of your work.  
有了BRAC，你可以决定什么时候工作，你是自主的，唯一重要的是你是否完成了你的工作。没有经理监督你，你也不必随时待命。你承担了很多责任，正因为如此，你要确保你真的做得很好。因为如果你不这样做，你就会失去工作。但是评估你的表现不再是为了表现，而是开始关注你的工作质量。

Many of us who have been working remotely for the last decade have also been async because they go together well.  
在过去的十年里，我们中的许多人一直在远程工作，他们也一直在远程工作，因为他们配合得很好。

## Async is life changing  
异步是改变生活

### Async for sleep 异步睡眠

Studies are increasingly proving people have different genetically predisposed chronotypes, meaning some people naturally wake up early in the morning, while others wake up closer to noon. Since the industrial revolution, we've been living in a society dominated by early birds while [night owls have been getting a bad deal](https://levels.io/night-owls/).  
越来越多的研究证明，人们有不同的遗传倾向的时钟类型，这意味着有些人自然醒来清晨，而其他人醒来接近中午。自工业革命以来，我们一直生活在一个早起的鸟儿占主导地位的社会，而夜猫子一直得到一个坏交易。

If you work async, you can work at the most optimal times for you.  
如果你工作的时间不长，你可以在最适合你的时间工作。

### Async for location independence  
异步实现位置独立性

Having to be on call at specific hours means you won't be able to travel or move to and live in different timezones. It's difficult for Americans to work from Asia (8am in New York is 8pm in Taipei), and it's difficult for Europeans to work from America (8am in Amsterdam is 3am in New York).  
必须在特定的时间待命意味着你将无法旅行或搬到不同的时区生活。美国人很难在亚洲工作（纽约早上8点是台北晚上8点），欧洲人很难在美国工作（阿姆斯特丹早上8点是纽约凌晨3点）。

If you work async, you're unrestricted by timezones and can live wherever you want in the world  
如果你在美国工作，你不受时区的限制，可以住在世界上任何你想住的地方。

### Async for deep work 异步进行深度工作

While sync work is littered with distractions of people who want your attention. Async work means you can be alone with your own thoughts and go into a creative flow state also known as [deep work:](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/?ref=levels.io)  
虽然同步工作充满了那些想要你注意的人的分心。异步工作意味着你可以独自思考，进入一种创造性的流动状态，也被称为深度工作：

> Cal Newport in Deep Work: "the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive."  
> 卡尔纽波特在深度工作：“从事深度工作的能力正变得越来越罕见，而与此同时，这种能力在我们的经济中正变得越来越有价值。因此，少数培养这种技能的人，然后把它作为他们工作生活的核心，将会茁壮成长。“

This means that increasingly async people will be able to output work of higher quality than sync people.  
这意味着越来越多的同步用户将能够比同步用户输出更高质量的工作。

### Async to avoid crowds 异步以避免拥挤

Maybe the biggest superpower of an async work life means you can do everything outside of peak hours.  
也许工作生活中最大的超能力意味着你可以在高峰时间之外做任何事情。

You can drive when roads are empty.  
你可以在路上空无一人的时候开车。

Go to the beach when everyone else is working.  
当其他人都在工作的时候去海滩。

Go to the gym mid-day when all equipment is available.  
中午去健身房，当所有的设备都可用的时候。

Go to the supermarket when there's no crowds like after 5pm when people get off work.  
去超市时，没有人，如下午5时后，当人们下班。

Book fun travel trips in the middle of the week when hotels are cheap and there's no crowds like in the weekend.  
在一周的中间预订有趣的旅行，那时酒店便宜，没有周末那样的人群。

Off-peak, you get everything almost instantly.  
在非高峰期，你几乎可以立即得到所有的东西。

### Async for health and happiness  
异步为健康和幸福

I think all these things culminate in lower stress, better health and increased happiness for asyncers.  
我认为所有这些都能降低压力，改善健康状况，增加幸福感。

Being able to live a more balanced life where work doesn't dictate your daily life structure, but you yourself choose it, seems like a much more healthy idea.  
能够过一种更平衡的生活，工作不决定你的日常生活结构，但你自己选择它，似乎是一个更健康的想法。

## The async-sync divide 同步-同步鸿沟

This is such a big advantage that I believe we'll see an increasingly big divide between people who can work async and those who can't.  
这是一个如此大的优势，我相信我们会看到一个越来越大的鸿沟之间的人谁可以工作，而那些谁不能。

Those who can (the asyncers) will be able to have a more free and peaceful life with less stress, less crowds, more focus on high quality deep work, more opportunity for fun, as well as being able to live wherever they want.  
那些能够做到的人将能够拥有更自由、更平静的生活，压力更小，人群更少，更专注于高质量的深度工作，更多的娱乐机会，以及能够生活在任何他们想要的地方。

Those who can't (the syncers) will remain stuck to working in archaic Monday to Friday 9 to 5 hours, being distracted by coworkers, with mediocre work output, while living their leisure life in the weekends, paying the highest prices to spend in crowded places with other syncers while getting stressed from being stuck in traffic and standing in lines everywhere, and being tied to a single timezone for work.  
那些不能（同步器）将继续坚持在古老的周一到周五工作9到5个小时，被同事分心，平庸的工作产出，而在周末过着他们的休闲生活，支付最高的价格与其他同步器一起在拥挤的地方消费，同时因交通堵塞和到处排队而感到压力，并被绑在一个单一的时区工作。

The dividing factor is that syncers disrupt the life of asyncers because one doesn't have the same freedom. The asyncer will have to limit their life to the syncer's work hours. Eventually a smart asyncer will decide either the syncer has to become async too or the asyncer calls it quits.  
分裂的因素是，同步器扰乱了同步器的生活，因为一个人没有同样的自由。他们将不得不把自己的生活限制在同步器的工作时间内。最终，一个聪明的同步器将决定要么同步器也必须成为同步器，要么同步器退出。

I believe that's why asyncers will congregate to each other. It's a better life.  
我相信这就是为什么吸血鬼会聚集在一起。这是更好的生活

## The next frontier to fight for

I believe async work is at the same place as remote work was just a few years ago.

Most people are _not_ convinced it works. But all the smart people are already doing it.

I don't know what it'll take to convince everyone of async's merits but I hope this blog post helps. And I believe we should fight to make async work the default, because as you see it will probably improve the life quality of millions and maybe billions of people. As the rise of remote work is doing now for so many.

## The future is async.

Well, I hope.

Thanks for listening. ❤️
