You may have noticed it's practically impossible to contact me. I did that on purpose so I can spend my time how I want to spend it. I don't really use email and I have my private message inboxes on every platform closed. And they have been like that for years.  
你可能已经注意到，几乎不可能联系到我。我故意这样做，这样我就可以花我的时间我想怎么花它。我真的不使用电子邮件，我有我的私人信息收件箱在每个平台关闭。他们已经这样好多年了。

I do read [public tweets sent to me](https://twitter.com/levelsio?ref=levels.io), and try to reply, but don't take private messages.  
我会阅读发给我的公开推文，并尝试回复，但不接受私人信息。

Most stuff about building startups I learnt by doing and [I brain dumped everything I know in a book](https://makebook.io/?ref=levels.io) I update about every few weeks.  
关于创业的大多数东西我都是通过实践来学习的，我把我所知道的一切都写在一本书里，每隔几周更新一次。

If you're low on time (like me), here's [**quick answers to most questions.**](https://levels.io/contact/#what-i-m-not-interested-in)  
如果你时间不多（像我一样），这里有大多数问题的快速答案。

Otherwise, keep reading why I made myself unreachable.  
否则，继续阅读为什么我让自己无法联系到。

**There's 24 hours in a day  
一天有24小时**  
I've tried to figure out and this is kind of a normal day for me:  
我试着弄明白，这对我来说是很平常的一天：

\+ 24 hours in a day  
\+ 一天24小时  
— 8 hours of sleeping = 16 hours left  
\- 8小时睡眠= 16小时  
— 1.5 hours of showering, cleaning up, coffee = 14.5 hours left  
\- 1.5小时的淋浴，清理，咖啡= 14.5小时  
— 4 hours of managing contractors, firefighting and fixing bugs = 10.5 hours left  
\- 4小时管理承包商、消防和修复漏洞= 10.5小时  
— 1 hours of groceries or errands = 9.5 hours left  
\- 1小时杂货或差事= 9.5小时  
— 1.5 hours of gym or going for a walk = 8 hours left  
\- 1.5小时健身房或散步= 8小时  
— 1.5 hours of staying in touch with friends/family = 6.5 hours left  
\- 1.5 hours of staying in touch with friends/family = 6.5小时left  
— 1.5 hours of cooking and eating = 5 hours left  
\- 1.5小时的烹饪和饮食= 5小时  
— 4 hours of deep work, building new features/products = 1 hours left  
\- 4 hours of deep work，building new features/products = 1小时left  
— 1 hours of sex/hugs/love = 0 hours left  
\- 1 hours of sex/hugs/love = 0小时left

It's all pretty tight. If I start answering everybody's messages, doing calls or taking on other people's projects, I wouldn't have enough time in the day.  
一切都很紧凑。如果我开始回复每个人的信息，打电话或接别人的项目，我一天就没有足够的时间了。

I'd start skipping the gym, skipping going for walks, skipping sex, and not being able to do deep work anymore. My health, relationships and work would slowly start falling apart. I know this as it's happened loads of time before. This schedule works for me and I don't want or need to change it.  
我开始不去健身房，不去散步，不做爱，不能再做深层次的工作了。我的健康，人际关系和工作将慢慢开始崩溃。我知道这是因为它发生了很多次。这个时间表对我很有效，我不想也不需要改变它。

(And no, [I don't schedule it exactly like this](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/pieter-levels-is-not-interested-in-doing-interviews-unless-it-s-for-indie-hackers-ab1215756c?commentId=-MWiJpZowjwSYvEMao0n&ref=levels.io), I'm not a robot; it's just an example of an average day.)  
(And不，我并没有像这样安排它，我不是一个机器人;这只是一个普通日子的例子。）

## Deep work 深度工作

If I keep getting distracted with messages/calls I can never get into flow state and my creative work will suffer. I have most of my notifications off and my devices are perpetually on Do Not Disturb mode from 00:00 to 23:59.  
如果我一直被信息/电话分心，我就永远无法进入流畅状态，我的创造性工作就会受到影响。我关闭了大部分通知，我的设备从00：00到23：59一直处于请勿打扰模式。

A lot of my new ideas slowly boil in my head over weeks, months, sometimes years. And undisturbed thinking and working time helps me get into that state. That's why I like to lead my life [async](https://levels.io/async).  
我的很多新想法在我的脑海里慢慢沸腾了几个星期，几个月，有时几年。不受干扰的思考和工作时间帮助我进入那种状态。所以我喜欢过一种自由的生活。

## You don't need my feedback  
你不需要我的反馈

People want my feedback on their startup but what they really need is feedback from customers. 99.999% of the times I'm not their customer.  
人们希望我对他们的创业提供反馈，但他们真正需要的是来自客户的反馈。99.999%的时候我不是他们的顾客

## You don't need me to figure out stuff  
你不需要我来解决问题

The most important skill I learnt is how to Google things and figure things out fast. If you always ask other people how to do stuff you'll never learn that skill. There's a lot of power in being able to operate autonomously and independent, it makes you an original person which increases the odds of you coming up with great ideas.  
我学到的最重要的技能是如何在谷歌上搜索并快速解决问题。如果你总是问别人怎么做的话，你永远也学不会那种技能。能够自主和独立地运作是很有力量的，它使你成为一个有创造力的人，这增加了你想出好主意的几率。

## Internet famous weirdness  
网上有名的怪事

It's hard to imagine what happens when you get internet famous but imagine when 50 people per day send you a message:  
很难想象当你在互联网上出名时会发生什么，但想象一下每天有50个人给你发信息：  
1) asking you to work with them,  
1)让你和他们一起工作  
2) asking you to [promote them or their app](https://twitter.com/search?q=to%3Alevelsio+producthunt.com+-from%3Aproducthunt+-from%3Aproducthunthi+-from%3Aproducthuntlive+-from%3Alevelsio&src=typed_query&f=live&ref=levels.io) (or [hunt it on PH](https://twitter.com/CinematicStApp/status/1383346633996308481?s=20&ref=levels.io)),  
2)要求你推广他们或他们的应用程序（或在PH上搜索它），  
3) writing giant multi-page dumps of their life stories irrelevant to you,  
3)写了很多与你无关的人生故事  
4) sending you unsolicited advice you didn't ask for,  
4)给你一些你没问过的建议  
5) getting angry with you because they used your site and didn't like it,  
5)因为他们使用了你的网站并且不喜欢而对你生气，  
6) getting angry with you if you don't reply,  
6)如果你不回复我就会生气  
7) sending you abuse and/or death threats,  
7)向你发送辱骂和/或死亡威胁  
8) stalking you and your friends (also in IRL)  
8)跟踪你和你的朋友（也在IRL）

Messages my friend [Cameron](https://twitter.com/camerondare?ref=levels.io) from GameQuitters gets in his DMs  
我的朋友卡梅隆从GameQuitters得到的消息在他的DM

All because you make websites that people use and you tweet/write about it. At some point you just realize it's better to shut down the inbox and focus on work.  
这一切都是因为你制作了人们使用的网站，你在推特上写了关于它的文章。

Many of my famous friends have the same problem, people more famous than me have proportionally crazier stories. [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/comment-page-3/?ref=levels.io) wrote about his experiences too, and they're fucking crazy.  
我的许多名人朋友都有同样的问题，比我更有名的人有比例更疯狂的故事。蒂姆·费里斯也写了他的经历，他们都很疯狂。

With an open inbox I'd get a lot of weird messages and making it impossible for people to message me helps because otherwise they start thinking you read what they send. Now everyone knows: no I won't read your message or anybody else's message.  
打开收件箱，我会收到很多奇怪的信息，让人们无法给我发信息是有帮助的，因为否则他们会开始认为你读了他们发的信息。现在每个人都知道：不，我不会读你的信息或任何人的信息。

Most people can't behave in private messages, especially not with anonymous accounts, which is sad because there's a good % of messages I would get that'd be great.  
大多数人不能在私人信息中表现出来，尤其是匿名账户，这很可悲，因为我会收到很好的信息。

## I don't have the time to reply  
我没时间回复

If I'd reply to the ~50 messages I get per day, and spend 5 minutes per message on them, it'd take me 4 hours to reply to everyone. No time for deep work then.  
如果我每天回复大约50条信息，每条信息花5分钟，那么我需要4个小时才能回复每个人。没有时间做深入的工作。

Even my startup idol [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/na?ref=levels.io) who legendarily would reply to every email stopped doing so recently and now just shares his knowledge as books instead.  
就连我的创业偶像德里克·西弗斯（Derek Sivers）也不例外，他会回复每一封电子邮件，但最近也不再这样做了，现在只是把他的知识作为书籍分享。

> “回答人们的问题占用了我所有的时间。所以我辞职了。“--德里克·西弗斯

My other startup idol [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?ref=levels.io) also closed his DMs recently. And my other inspiration [Yongfook](https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1376007508255416322?s=20&ref=levels.io) seems to have the same problem.    
我的另一个创业偶像帕特里克麦肯齐最近也关闭了他的DM。而我的另一个灵感永福似乎也有同样的问题。

## Life is short 人生苦短

Our days are numbered and like you I want to spend my limited time in the best way. Ruthlessly cutting out distractions helps.  
我们的日子屈指可数，和你一样，我想以最好的方式度过我有限的时间。无情地切断干扰有助于。

Prioritizing responding to DMs from strangers if my girlfriend is sitting next to me and wants a hug, or my friend wants to go for a walk, or I haven't called my parents in a week, or there's a critical bug on my sites. It'd be stupid to.  
如果我的女朋友坐在我旁边，想要一个拥抱，或者我的朋友想去散步，或者我一周没有给我的父母打电话，或者我的网站上有一个严重的错误，那么优先回复陌生人的DM。那太蠢了

## What I'm not interested in  
我不感兴趣的

I'm not interested in collaborating, I like to work alone. Or with people I hire. If I hire people I find you, you don't need to message me.  
我对合作不感兴趣，我喜欢独自工作。或者我雇的人。如果我雇人我就能找到你，你不用给我发信息。

I'm not interested in doing client work for other people, I never did, and my goal was to never have a boss and I'm difficult to work with anyway, and I make enough money so I don't need to.  
我对为别人做客户工作不感兴趣，我从来没有，我的目标是永远不要有老板，我很难与之合作，我赚了足够的钱，所以我不需要。

I'm not interested in fixing your printer or WiFi router.  
我对修理你的打印机或WiFi路由器不感兴趣。

I'm not interested in doing press anymore, because I've had so many bad experiences where the journalist took my words of context, and turned what would be an interesting article into a hit piece to cancel me or my business. [I'm not the only one that's happened to](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Abalajis+journalists&src=typed_query&ref=levels.io), it's how the media makes money these days.  
我对做新闻不再感兴趣了，因为我有过很多不好的经历，记者把我的话当作上下文，把一篇有趣的文章变成一篇热门文章，取消我或我的生意。我不是唯一一个这样的人，这就是媒体赚钱的方式。

I don't do support for my sites, instead I've made most my sites self-serve and hired customer support people. I do product development only.  
我不为我的网站提供支持，相反，我让我的大多数网站自助服务，并聘请客户支持人员。我只做产品开发。

I'm not interested in you translating my sites or book, or making an audio or paper version of my book, or re-distributing it. I work alone and happy with keeping 100% of my revenue. Google Translate works fine and paper is dead.  
我对你翻译我的网站或书不感兴趣，或者制作我的书的音频或纸质版本，或者重新分发它。我独自工作，并乐于保持100%的收入。谷歌翻译工作正常，纸张已经死了。

I'm not at all interested in doing calls, or podcasts, or joining Clubhouse rooms. Unless it's [Indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts?ref=levels.io) or a podcast I listen to myself like [Joe Rogan](https://old.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/ix7lcx/i_made_a_small_service_to_convert_spotify/?ref=levels.io).  
我对打电话、播客或加入俱乐部房间一点也不感兴趣。除非是Indiehackers或播客，否则我会像Joe Rogan一样听自己的声音。

I'm not interested in VC or angel investment, my companies are healthy and I have enough money to re-invest. I also don't want to become a $100 million or $1 billion company. I'd just be diluting my 100% ownership and probably make less than I make now. Also even if you sell, what the hell would you spend $100 million or $1 billion on? A boat? Okay and then? It sounds stressful. You're not a normal part of society anymore. Everybody will bug you for money. No thanks. I'm happy with where I'm at now.  
我对风险投资或天使投资不感兴趣，我的公司很健康，我有足够的钱再投资。我也不想成为一家1亿美元或10亿美元的公司。我只会稀释我100%的所有权，可能比我现在赚得少。而且，即使你卖掉了，你到底会花1亿美元还是10亿美元买什么？一艘船？好吧然后呢听起来压力很大。你不再是社会的正常人了。每个人都会缠着你要钱。不了谢谢我对现在的状态很满意。

I'm not interested in proposals to buy my companies. 99% of proposals are not serious. I went through one 6-month process of due diligence and the acquisition bounced off as it was a trick to get a list of my customers. I'm not doing that again. Nor do I need to sell. Why would I throw away a high margin cash flow that keeps me happy by working on it every day for a lump sum of money to then do nothing? Meaningful work makes me happy. Not doing anything doesn't. If I ever sell, I'll find a buyer myself through [FEI](https://feinternational.com/?ref=levels.io) or [Empire Flippers](http://empireflippers.com/?ref=levels.io) (not affiliated but they're nice).  
我对收购我公司的提议不感兴趣。99%的提案都不严肃。我经历了一个为期6个月的尽职调查过程，收购失败了，因为这是一个获取客户名单的技巧。我不会再这么做了我也不需要卖。我为什么要扔掉一个高利润的现金流，让我高兴的工作，每天一笔钱，然后什么也不做？有意义的工作让我快乐。什么都不做就不是。如果我卖了，我会通过FEI或Empire Flippers自己找到买家（没有附属机构，但他们很好）。

I'm not interested in traveling to places to do conference talks or workshops for 300 people when I literally reach 1,000x to 10,000x as many people by building a new product or feature, by writing a tweet or blog or by making a YouTube video. It's not worth the effort. I'd make an exception for a big conference like [TED](http://ted.com/?ref=levels.io), but that's about it.  
当我通过开发一个新产品或功能，通过写一条推文或博客，或者通过制作一个YouTube视频，达到1,000倍到10,000倍的人数时，我对去300人的地方做会议演讲或研讨会不感兴趣。不值得你这么做。我会为像TED这样的大型会议破例，但仅此而已。

But what about meeting people and making new friends? I already have a close knit group of friends that have my back.  
但是如何认识人和交新朋友呢？我已经有一群亲密的朋友支持我。

## What I am interested in  
我感兴趣的

Spending time with people I love.  
和我爱的人在一起。

Spending time with people that spark my curiosity.  
花时间和激发我好奇心的人在一起。

Spending time on my health like cooking nice food, doing fitness, sports, etc.  
花时间在我的健康上，比如烹饪美味的食物，做健身，运动等。

Traveling to new places and exploring them alone or with my girlfriend or friends.  
去新的地方旅行，独自或与我的女朋友或朋友一起探索它们。

Hacking on creative projects, reading about stuff I'm curious about, or working on new businesses I'm passionate about.  
从事创造性的项目，阅读我感兴趣的东西，或者从事我热爱的新业务。

Inspiring people to create stuff by sharing what I make and writing about it on here and Twitter.  
鼓励人们通过分享我的作品来创造东西，并在这里和Twitter上写下来。

Sharing stuff with my followers that sparks my curiosity.  
与我的追随者分享激发我好奇心的东西。

Doing anything high impact to  
做任何高影响力的事  
1) [accelerate the freedom of global movement enabled by remote work](https://nomadlist.com/faq?ref=levels.io)  
1)通过远程工作加速全球移动的自由  
2) [accelerate society towards async living](https://levels.io/async/)  
2)加速社会向现代化生活迈进  
3) normalize transparency in business by [open startups](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/968219339588493312?s=20&ref=levels.io) and [open salaries](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Alevelsio+opensalaries&src=typed_query&f=live&ref=levels.io).  
3)通过开放创业和公开工资使商业透明度正常化。

## Maybe you don't need to be reachable either  
也许你也不需要被联系到

My situation seems different because I already have successful companies but maybe it's not that different from yours, because regardless of that, this applies to you too:  
我的情况似乎不同，因为我已经有了成功的公司，但也许它与你的不同，因为无论如何，这也适用于你：

Most things are a distraction, especially in the startup and tech world.  
大多数事情都是分散注意力的，尤其是在创业和科技领域。

If you get to the core of building companies it's about **creating a great product that gets customers that pay for it**.  
如果你进入了建立公司的核心，那就是创造一个伟大的产品，让客户为之付费。

If you get to the core of life it's **living an existence you're proud of with people you love** doing the things you like while minimizing suffering.  
如果你找到了生活的核心，那就是和你爱的人一起过着你引以为豪的生活，做着你喜欢的事情，同时把痛苦降到最低。

None of these two involve being available for endless chit-chatting to billions of people in private messages. [Everything from everyone all the time is too much.](https://world.hey.com/dhh/no-more-platforms-please-8f01445e?ref=levels.io)  
这两者都不涉及在私人信息中与数十亿人进行无休止的聊天。所有人的一切都太多了。

It's okay to say no, embrace the silence and find your focus.  
说不没关系，拥抱沉默，找到你的焦点。
