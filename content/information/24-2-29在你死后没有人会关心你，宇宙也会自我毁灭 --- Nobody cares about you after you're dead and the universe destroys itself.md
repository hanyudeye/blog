## Quarter life crisis  四分之一生命危机

Many people around age 26-30 get a quarter life crisis. It usually happens after you've graduated university, have been working for a few years and start getting the itching feeling "is this it?". You then might feel lack of meaning in your life, start getting panic attacks, feeling tense all day, get [derealization](https://levels.io/anxiety/) as if you're living in the Matrix or some simulated reality, depression and insomnia from thinking too much. Also an obsession with your age and goals you need to hit before a certain age is common. Many people also call it [Saturn Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_return?ref=levels.io), it's like a late 20s rite of passage:  
许多26-30岁的人都有四分之一的生命危机。它通常发生在你大学毕业后，工作了几年，开始有痒的感觉“是这样吗？“.然后，你可能会觉得生活缺乏意义，开始恐慌发作，整天感到紧张，好像你生活在黑客帝国或一些模拟现实中，抑郁和失眠，因为想得太多。同样，对你的年龄和你需要在某个年龄之前达到的目标的痴迷也很常见。许多人也称之为土星回归，这就像是20年代后期的仪式：

> In horoscopic astrology, a Saturn return is an astrological transit that occurs when the planet Saturn returns to the same place in the sky that it occupied at the moment of a person's birth. While the planet may not reach the exact spot until the person is 29 or 30 years old, the influence of the Saturn return is considered to start in the person's late twenties, notably the age of 27.  
> 在占星术中，土星回归是当土星回到一个人出生时所占据的天空中的同一个地方时发生的占星术过境。虽然行星可能不会到达确切的地点，直到人是29或30岁，土星返回的影响被认为是开始在人的20多岁，特别是27岁。

I got this too. And relatedly, I used to have severe anxiety about this stuff before my [quarter life crisis](https://levels.io/love-anxiety-and-startups/).  
我还有这个。与此相关的是，在我的四分之一生命危机之前，我曾经对这些东西有严重的焦虑。

Like most late 20s people of this generation having a quarter life crisis, I was terrified of death, my time remaining and what to do with it.  
就像这一代大多数20多岁的人有四分之一的生命危机，我害怕死亡，我剩下的时间和如何处理它。

## Meaning 意义

If we die anyway, why does anything matter anyway? I tried to avoid answering this question by becoming extremely ambitious, working really hard and trying to get successful. I though if I just did that, I'd optimize my time in the most useful way and somehow that'd matter.  
如果我们都要死了，那还有什么意义呢？我试图避免回答这个问题，变得非常雄心勃勃，非常努力地工作，试图获得成功。我想，如果我这样做，我会以最有用的方式优化我的时间，不知何故，这很重要。

But of course, it doesn't work that way. It just made things worse.  
但当然，它不是这样工作的。只会让事情变得更糟。

## Nihilism  虚无主义

It took years for my anxiety to mostly go away and ironically what caused me most of my crisis was also what solved it: the realization that nothing matters.  
我的焦虑花了好几年才基本消失，具有讽刺意味的是，导致我大部分危机的原因也是解决它的原因：意识到没有什么是重要的。

You can approach the nihilism of that in a positive or negative way. Negatively that means whatever you do, it doesn't matter, so you can just as well do nothing. Positively it means whatever you do, it doesn't matter, so you can now just enjoy the thing you do intrinsically. Not for the end purpose. So that's what I do now, I'm here just to enjoy the ride.  
你可以以积极或消极的方式接近虚无主义。消极地说，这意味着无论你做什么，都无关紧要，所以你也可以什么都不做。积极地说，这意味着无论你做什么，都不重要，所以你现在可以从本质上享受你所做的事情。不是为了最终目的。所以这就是我现在所做的，我在这里只是为了享受这段旅程。

The [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe?ref=levels.io) will destroy everything anyway back to [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy?ref=levels.io) or even more, pure nothingness:  
宇宙的热寂将摧毁一切，回到熵，甚至更多，纯粹的虚无：

## Legacy 遗产

A lot of people from my generation are obsessed with legacy. Like "leaving their mark on the world" or "changing the world". Especially in tech. Since tech is everyone now, essentially everyone from my generation.  
我们这一代的很多人都痴迷于遗产。就像“在世界上留下印记”或者“改变世界”。尤其是在技术方面。因为科技现在是每个人，基本上是我这一代的每个人。

I think this is highly related to this search for meaning. Before atheism we had religion and before religion we had superstition. Religion and superstition gave us meaning to do things. Religion would get you to heaven after death and we'd use superstition as a "belief in supernatural causation leading to certain consequences of an action or event". If you have none of those, legacy is one of the last remaining obvious reasons to do things. You'll be remembered for your actions!  
我认为这与寻找意义密切相关。在无神论之前，我们有宗教，在宗教之前，我们有迷信。宗教和迷信给了我们做事的意义。宗教会让你死后上天堂，我们会用迷信作为“对超自然因果关系的信仰，导致某种行为或事件的某些后果”。如果你没有这些，遗产是做事情的最后一个明显的理由。你的行为将被铭记！

But will you, really? 但你真的会吗？

People will probably have forgotten you and your achievements within a generation or two.    
人们可能会在一两代人的时间内忘记你和你的成就。

Even if you start a successful company, [the average life span of a S&P 500 company is less than 20 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/technology-killing-off-corporations-average-lifespan-of-company-under-20-years.html?ref=levels.io). It'll either fail, be bought up, merged and renamed.  
即使你创办了一家成功的公司，标准普尔500指数成分股公司的平均寿命也不到20年。它要么倒闭，要么被收购，要么被合并，要么被改名。

And if you get super famous, you'll probably be forgotten too within 100 years. How many famous people from 100 years ago do you know now? Not a lot.  
如果你变得超级有名，你可能也会在100年内被遗忘。100年前的名人你现在认识多少？不多。

105 billion people were born before us, and how many historic figures are there? Maybe hundreds, maybe thousands? So your odds of being remembered is something like 1,000 famous historic people divided by (105,000,000,000 people ever lived + 7 billion people currently living) = 0.000000892857% percent or a 1 in 112,000,000 chance.  
1050亿人在我们之前出生，有多少历史人物？也许是几百个，也许是几千个。所以你被记住的几率是1,000个著名的历史人物除以（1050亿人曾经生活过+70亿人现在生活）= 0.000000892857%或者1.12亿分之一的几率。

Even then, we're only counting the human people who lived until now. That's incredibly microscopic odds.  
即便如此，我们也只计算了活到现在的人类。这是非常微小的几率。

And even then, **you'll be dead**. How can you enjoy your legacy, **when you're dead?**  
即使那样，你也会死。你死了，怎么能享受你的遗产？

## So what's left if: 那么，如果：

-   you're not superstitious 你不迷信
-   you're not religious 你不信教
-   we just debunked the odds that you'll be remembered for your legacy  
    我们刚刚打破了你会因为你的遗产而被铭记的可能性

Well yes, intrinsic motivation and meaning. Enjoying the ride and whatever you do for the thing itself.  
是的，内在动机和意义。享受这段旅程，以及你为这件事所做的一切。

> Just enjoy your tea and a cookie. And be nice to the people around you. That's all there is. Everything else is just filling time.  
> 好好享受你的茶和饼干吧。善待你周围的人。就这些了。其他的一切都只是在消磨时间。
