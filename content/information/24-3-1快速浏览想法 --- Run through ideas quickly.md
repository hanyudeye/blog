> If I had to give any advice, it would be to **run through ideas quickly**. If they’re not gaining traction, or they’re a struggle to grow, drop them and move on to the next idea.  
> 如果非要我给予什么建议的话，那就是快速浏览一下想法。如果他们没有获得牵引力，或者他们正在努力成长，放弃他们，继续下一个想法。
> 
> This isn’t going to be true for everyone, but each of my successful projects was a success from day one. I posted them online, pointed a few communities towards them like Reddit, and ended up with a few thousand registered users in the first day. That then dropped to a few hundred daily registrations and went up from there for the coming years. They’ve still been a lot of work, but **I knew I had something the instant they went live**.  
> 这并不适用于每个人，但我的每个成功项目从第一天起就成功了。我把它们发布到网上，向Reddit等社区推荐了它们，结果在第一天就有了几千个注册用户。然后下降到每天几百个注册，并从那里上升到未来几年。他们仍然有很多工作，但我知道我有东西的瞬间，他们去生活。

> Every project I launched that was difficult, never went anywhere. There were a handful of sites I started where I was working hard to build traffic and it was always the same, a spike, then nothing a week later. Some of these I worked on for months, one project I developed over the course of a year. **My two or three successful projects were built within a week or two.** They were rough, but provided something of value, and I could build them from there.  
> 我发起的每一个项目都很困难，从来没有成功过。有几个网站，我开始在那里我努力工作，以建立流量，它总是一样的，一个高峰，然后没有一个星期后。其中一些我花了几个月的时间，有一个项目是我花了一年的时间开发的。我的两三个成功的项目是在一两周内完成的。它们很粗糙，但提供了一些有价值的东西，我可以从那里建立它们。

> No one hits a homerun every time. Look at Facebook, Google, and Microsoft struggle. These are companies with unlimited budgets, and some of the best in the industry. They fail. Often. It doesn’t matter if you fail 90% of the time though, **you just need to burn through those ten ideas to find the one that works. If you get hung up on the first idea, and devote all your finances and time for years, you’ll never get to the good one.**  
> 没有人每次都能打出全垒打。看看Facebook、谷歌和微软的斗争。这些公司拥有无限的预算，其中一些是行业中最好的。他们失败了。经常即使你90%的时间都失败了也没关系，你只需要把这十个想法烧掉，找到一个有效的想法。如果你在第一个想法上就挂了电话，多年来投入了你所有的资金和时间，你永远不会得到好的。
